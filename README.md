# Instruction
I forked this repository from renew-wireless/RENEWLab.

I mainly try to use the data gathered by RENEWLab in MMNet and see how it works.

The code in this project is mostly in PYTHON/IrisUtils/ repository.

The way how to use it and more details are written in the `readme.md` of repository of PYTHON/IrisUtils/
