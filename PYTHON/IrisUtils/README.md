# Instruction

I mainly use the Python code `plot_hdf5.py` at line 341 and `hdf5_lib.py` at line 652 to abstract the uplink data and channel data which are both generated by RENEWLab.

After getting the required data for the MMNet Model, I can start to fit the collected data into the Model.

The code of MMNet is put in the directory `learning_based_usetfv1` and for more detail you can see the README.md document in that directory.
